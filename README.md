## Some tech favs...

- Using React. It feels very intuitive and dynamic. It's a pleasure to use, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge of its capabilities and implementations.
- CSS is a tool that Iâ€™ve grown to find very satisfying. I appreciate the creativity and expression it allows me to bring to my work.
- Using ORMs like Sequelize and SQLAlchemy is very rewarding to my brain. Examining the relationships between different data collections and figuring out a logical way to organize information is very gratifying.

## A little more about me...  

- ðŸŽ¬ Before I got into tech, I had a successful career working on television shows including Modern Family, Silicon Valley, and The New Girl.
- ðŸŒˆ Current Goals: Make new connections with interesting and kind people working
  in tech and learning to cook Thai food.
- ðŸŽ¶ Favorite Job: Working in a record store in my early 20s (unfortunately it paid 
  $6.50/hour).
- ðŸŒŽ I've lived in Los Angeles, CA for over a decade, but I grew up in South Carolina.

## A little more about me...  

- 🌎 I've lived in Los Angeles, CA for over a decade, but I grew up in South Carolina.
- 🎬 Before I got into tech, I had a successful career working on television shows including Modern Family, Silicon Valley, and The New Girl.
- 🌈 Current Goals: Make new connections with interesting and kind people working in tech and learning to cook Thai food.
- 🏆 I'm also having a great interest in competitive programming.
- 🎶 Favorite Job: Working in a record store in my early 20s (unfortunately it paid $6.50/hour).
- 📫 How to reach me: elizawimberly@gmail.com
